I'm a  Coolman413 a Developer at Little Harvard llc, which maintains a mix of education and fun interactive products, in-house frameworks based around .net, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and SQL, and modern frameworks such as React. native for newer projects.


Many of my personal projects have been created using JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL and C#, I am always looking to challenge myself and learn something new when I take on a new project.


When I'm not programming, I spend a lot of time with my family building my faith, and spending good times with friends.
